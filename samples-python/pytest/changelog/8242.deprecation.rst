Raising :class:`unittest.SkipTest` to skip collection of tests during the
pytest collection phase is deprecated. Use :func:`pytest.skip` instead.

Note: This deprecation only relates to using :class:`unittest.SkipTest` during test
collection. You are probably not doing that. Ordinary usage of
:class:`unittest.SkipTest` / :meth:`unittest.TestCase.skipTest` /
:func:`unittest.skip` in unittest test cases is fully supported.
