The ``@pytest.mark.skip`` decorator now correctly handles its arguments. When the ``reason`` argument is accidentally given both positional and as a keyword (e.g. because it was confused with ``skipif``), a ``TypeError`` now occurs. Before, such tests were silently skipped, and the positional argument ignored. Additionally, ``reason`` is now documented correctly as positional or keyword (rather than keyword-only).
