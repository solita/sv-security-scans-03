/**
 * Provides examples of Java's instanceof operator's support for pattern matching, which was finalised in JDK 16
 * (March 2021), implemented in a JUnit test case.
 * <p>
 * Pattern matching is the term given to the common need to combine testing whether an object has a certain type, and
 * then conditionally extracting components of its state for further processing. It comprises three steps - 1) a test
 * to determine whether variable is of the given type; 2) if it is, a conversion (cast) of the variable to the more
 * specific type, and 3) the declaration of a new local variable of the more specific type so that its behaviour can
 * be used.
 * <p>
 * Java's longstanding instanceof operator has been extended to provide built-in language support for expressing
 * pattern matching. Prior to JDK 16 the operator was already being used to implement pattern matching, but only
 * offered partial support - the operator performed the first step (the type test), but the other two steps (cast
 * and declaration) needed to be manually coded in full. The instanceof operator is now extended to additionally
 * support the other two steps also by adding support for declaring a pattern variable when the object is matched.
 * This reduces the verbosity (boilerplate) of the Java code.
 * <p>
 * A pattern variable is to all intents and purposes a local variable, but with some differences in how its scope
 * is defined.
 * <p>
 * In its first final release in JDK 16 the instanceof operator only supports extracting a single pattern variable -
 * a single variable of the matched type.
 *

 * 1) <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/394">JEP 394: Pattern Matching for instanceof</a> - The final Java
 * Enhancement Proposal (JEP) for extending the instanceof operator to support pattern matching, describes the
 * motivation for the enhancement and provides more details, with examples.
