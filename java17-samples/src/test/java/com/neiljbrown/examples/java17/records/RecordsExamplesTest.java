/**
 * Provides examples of the use of Records, a new language feature that was finalised in JDK 16 (March 2021),
 * implemented as a JUnit test case.
 * <p>
 * A {@link java.lang.Record Record} is a new type of Java class that is designed to make it easier to declare
 * immutable data-structures in Java, with less code than has traditionally been necessary, and in so doing also make
 * the code easier to read, interpret and maintain. This is achieved by the Java compiler using a declaration of a
 * Record's state (which is specified in terms of component field names and types) to auto-generate standard
 * (boilerplate) implementations of members including corresponding fields, a constructor, accessor methods, and
 * equals and hashCode methods.
 * <p>
 * Records are implicitly final (cannot be extended) and their state is immutable. They are designed primarily to
 * support implementing 'nominally-typed' (types declared by name, rather than structure) tuples (data-structures).
 * Common use-cases for Records include declaring Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects (DTO), composite return types,
 * and composite Map keys.
 *
 * <h2>Further Reading</h2>
 * 1) <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395">JEP 395: Records</a> - The final Java Enhancement Proposal (JEP)
 * for Records, describes the goals and motivation for the feature, plus a detailed description of how it is proposed
 * to work (its specification and design) including examples.
