/**
 * Provides examples of using Switch Expressions, implemented as a JUnit test case.
 * <p>
 * From JDK 14 (March 2020) onwards, Java allows the switch keyword to be used to declare an expression, whilst
 * continuing to support the original switch statement. In addition to making it easier to write and maintain switch
 * statements by reducing some of the associated boilerplate for common cases, this change is also part of a broader
 * project to enhance Java to support pattern matching. (See below for more details)
 * <p>
 * In summary, switch expressions provide the following new features to address problems with switch statements -
 * 1) The ability to write a single case label to match multiple values, rather than needing one case per value.
 * 2) Variables declared in a case block are now private in scope to that block rather than global for all
 * subsequent case blocks.
 * 3) Execution of case blocks no longer fall through to the next case block by default, which removes the need to
 * write break statements at the end of case blocks in the most common cases, removing a common source of bugs.
 * 4) You can return a value from a case block that can be assigned to a local var, i.e. switch is now an expression.
 *
 * <h2>Further Reading</h2>
 * 1) <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361">Java Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 361: Switch Expressions</a>
 * - The original proposal for adding switch expressions to the language, includes motivation and examples.
 * <p>
 * 2) One of the motives for adding Switch Expressions to the language is to allow 'pattern matching' to be coded more
 * concisely and safely. Pattern matching is logic that combines testing whether an object has a certain type or
 * structure, and then conditionally extracting components of its state for further processing. For more details see
